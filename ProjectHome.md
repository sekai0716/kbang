# KBang #

**2009-11-05: daVinci Editrice oficialy [announced](http://www.davincigames.com/download/CSenglish_bang.pdf) the release of "BANG! the videogame" due within February 2010. As the CEO of daVinci Editrice told me, this is the main reason why they cannot give us permission to use the copyrighted material.**


**2009-10-16: Unfortunately I did not manage to make a deal with daVinci and I decided to close down the project. I am also planning to create a new one that would be based on the original source codes, but without any copyrighted material. Stay tuned or join our mailing list.**

**2009-10-14: I have just received an email from daVinci complaining about copyright violations. They request me to remove copyrighted material from the project. For now, the download section has been disabled.**

## Updates ##

### 2009-08-18 - I'm back ###
Hi everyone, I'm finally back from vacation and ready to go on with the project. I hope there will be some new stuff soon. Stay tuned.

### 2009-07-09 - I'm on vacation ###
As many of you know, I created KBang as a bachelor thesis and two weeks ago I managed to defend it with the grade _excellent_. So I would like to thank everyone who took part on testing and playing KBang. You've really helped me to catch the most crucial bugs and without such betatesters I certainly wouldn't get _excellent_.

After a lot of work I need a break, so in couple of days I'm going to set out for Spain - a little hitchhike trip. I'm afraid I'll be away from the Internet so I cannot react on your requests and mails. But you can carry on submiting bugreports and sending glorifying emails:).. I respond as soon as I get back (which should be probably in a month or so).

So enjoy KBang and see you on Alderan..
